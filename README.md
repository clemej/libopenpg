libopenpg
=========

A Python library implementing Open Planar Graphs

Requirements
============

This python library uses the NetworkX graph library, so you will need that
installed on your system to use the library.  On debian-derived Linux 
distributions you can install this with the command

 $ sudo apt-get install python-networkx

Overview
========

This library is a work-in-progress implementation of Open Planar Graphs
as descriped in the paper

> "Polynomial Algorithms for Open Plane Graph and Subgraph Isomorphism by 
de la Higuera, Janodet, Samuel, et al."
